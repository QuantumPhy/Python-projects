# Python-projects

Python projects spanning from deep learning to nlp in Tensorflow.

## Project descriptions

I will briefly describe all of the projects/folders in this repo. Folders not mentioned are unfinished or obsolete. You will need [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in order to run scripts in deep_learning_udc, and tensorflow_projects folders.

### Deep_learning_udc folder

This folder contains jupyter notebook assignments solved by me for the deep learning course on udacity.

### MIT-AI folder

This folder contains lab problems partially solved by me from the AI course at [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/assignments/).

### aima-python-master folder

This folder contains python examples from the Artificial Intelligence book by Peter Norvig. I just copied [this](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) github repository.

### deep_nlp_stanford folder

This folder contains assignments from the [deep nlp course](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) from stanford.

### sentiment_analysis

This is a simple positive and negative sentimenty analyzer I made using a bag of words model.

### tensorflow_projects

You can find two projects here which I cloned from [here](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial) and [here](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare).
